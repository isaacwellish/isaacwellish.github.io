<p id = "myNameId" class = "pageTitle">about me</p>
<p id = "projectsId" class = "pageSubTitle">I always found learning technical skills traditionally to be boring. Art and music are fun which is how I learned coding and electronics. I now get to develop creative, music themed, STEM projects for Adafruit Industries on their learning platform as a project and guide creator! I also teach electronics classes and assist with the education program at the Staten Island Makerspace.</p>
