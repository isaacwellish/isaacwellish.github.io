<p id = "myNameId" class = "pageTitle">about me</p>
<p id = "projectsId" class = "pageSubTitle">I am fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. While spending a large part of my time in undergrad learning to produce, mix, and master music, I became interested in how different recording technology worked and how I was interacting with the technology itself. I travelled to Northern Ireland in the fall of 2015 to study at the The Sonic Arts Research Center where I developed knowledge on the future of music technology and human interaction in art. As part of my senior project I became quite familiar with Arduino, soldering, CAD, and 3D printing in order to create a music technology related venture. I'm currently enrolled in Lehigh University's Master of Engineering in Technical Entrepreneurship program.</p>
